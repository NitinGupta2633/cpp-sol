another quote that I like: “money on its own is neither good nor bad. it is a means to an end” again, this is not to say that money is not important. it is to say that money is not “dirty,” but money is also not everything. money is a tool that enables you to protect yourself, to build yourself and your family a better life, and to give back to your community.
money is important because having money means that you will not be destitute. it means that you are not dependent on being employed, living paycheck to paycheck, and having to put up with abuse by your boss because you badly need your job.
money is important because it enables you to have more control over your life, more freedom to carve out your own path, and fewer constraints on your choices. how many of us are stuck in a career or in a job we hate, but cannot afford to lose because losing our job would mean losing our house and our health insurance? my own mother, a brilliant young woman with a bright future and scholarships to the best universities, back in the sixties, had to give up her dreams, forget about college and start working as a clerk because her parents were so poor and needed her to support them. it’s a sad story of unrealized potential, and the only reason she did not realize her potential was that her parents were poor.
money is important because it means being able to give your children the best – the best education, the best health care, the best start in life. of course, when it comes to kids, money can also greatly spoil them, so it’s up to wealthy parents to find a way to give their kids the best, while still teaching them the value of money and not giving them so much excess that their view on life is forever skewed.
